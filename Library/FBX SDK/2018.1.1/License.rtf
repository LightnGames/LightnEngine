At Autodesk\rquote s request, Licensee agrees to destroy or return to Autodesk or the Reseller from which they were acquired all copies of the Previous Version.  Autodesk reserves the right to require Licensee to show satisfactory proof that all copies of any Previous Version have been Uninstalled and, if so requested by Autodesk, destroyed or returned to Autodesk or the Reseller from which they were acquired.\par
\pard\nowidctlpar\fi720\sa120\sl276\slmult1 1.2.2\tab\ul Exception for Relationship Program Licensees\ulnone .  The termination of rights as to Previous Versions described in Section 1.2.1 (Effect of Upgrades) may not apply to Licensee if and to the extent (a) Licensee participates in a Relationship Program and the Relationship Program Terms authorize Licensee to retain such Previous Versions or (b) otherwise authorized in writing by Autodesk.\par

In no event will the foregoing result in any rights with respect to Excluded Materials.\par
1.5\tab\ul Authorized Users\ulnone .  Licensee may permit the Licensed Materials to be Installed and/or Accessed only by Licensee\rquote s Personnel (except as otherwise designated in the applicable License Type), and any such Installation or Access will be subject to any other requirements imposed by this Agreement and the applicable License Type and Permitted Number.

Copies of the Licensed Materials that are Installed and are in excess of the Permitted Number at any time while the primary copy of the Licensed Materials is also Accessible are not "archival copies" as permitted under this Section 1.9 (Archival Copy).\par
1.10\tab\ul Nature of Licenses\ulnone .  Licensee acknowledges and agrees that when Licensee acquires a license of Licensed Materials, (including through a Relationship Program or Services), Licensee\rquote s acquisition is neither contingent on the delivery of any future features or functionality nor subject to any public or other comments (oral, written or otherwise) made by Autodesk regarding future features or functionality.\par

Such connectivity to Autodesk websites is governed by Autodesk\rquote s policies on privacy and data protection described in this Section 4 (Privacy; Use of Information; Connectivity).  Such connectivity to websites of third parties is governed by the terms (including the disclaimers and notices) found on such sites or otherwise associated with the third-party content or services.

Such refund is subject to the return, during the Warranty Period, of the Autodesk Materials, with a copy of Licensee\rquote s License Identification, to Licensee\rquote s local Autodesk office or the Reseller from which Licensee acquired the Autodesk Materials.

Particularly in the case of commercial professional use, the Licensed Materials and Services are not a substitute for Licensee\rquote s professional judgment or independent testing.  The Licensed Materials and Services are intended only to assist Licensee with its design, analysis, simulation, estimation, testing and/or other activities and are not a substitute for Licensee\rquote s own independent design, analysis, simulation, estimation, testing, and/or other activities, including those with respect to product stress, safety and utility.  Due to the large variety of potential applications for the Licensed Materials and Services, the Licensed Materials and Services have not been tested in all situations under which they may be used.  Autodesk will not be liable in any manner whatsoever for the results obtained through use of the Licensed Materials or Services.  Persons using the Licensed Materials or Services are responsible for the supervision, management, and control of the Licensed Materials and Services and the results of using the Licensed Materials and Services.
